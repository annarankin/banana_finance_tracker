### To-Do:

- Bootstrap Express App w/index page
- Set up MongoDB - consider using Mongoose
- Front End - should probably use Angular. Ugh I miss Backbone. React looks cool.
- Seed data
- Bower components
- Gulp tasks - setup, watch
- Learn SASS right quick
- Let's write some tests! Jasmine? Mochachai? WHO KNOWS maybe Protractor
